This project started from a tutorial in JS30 where I was taught how to use the canvas API. 
Written in pure JS with no extra library.

Extra things I added:
- extend to a working simple drawing app
    - undo/redo functions (limited at 50 steps max to save memory)
    - clear canvas
    - palette with color picker
    - changable brush size
    - export function so we can save our works
    - minimal and pleasant looking UI
