# simpleCanvasDemo
This project started from a tutorial in JS30 where I was taught how to use the canvas API. 
Written in pure JS with no extra library.

Things I added to extend it to a fully functional app:
- undo/redo functions (limited at 50 steps max to save memory)
- clear canvas
- palette with color picker
- changable brush size
- export function so we can save our works
- minimal and pleasant looking UI
